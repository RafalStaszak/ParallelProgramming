/**
 * The goal of program is to carry out all the tasks. The execution time of a single is given in the "time_per_task"
 * list. Write two program, both single and multi threaded ones, which can complete all the tasks.
 *
 * Hints:
 * How single-threaded program should work:
 * It loops through the list "time_per_task".
 * On each iteration the function "task" is executed.
 *
 * How multi-threaded program should work:
 * Each thread seeks for uncompleted tasks.
 * After finding an uncompleted task the thread blocks the access to that task. (It cannot be done twice by any
 * other thred).
 * After all the tasks have been completed all the threads stop their execution.
 *
 * Write your own functions, mutexes, locks!
